\subsection{Set L}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $C$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. So $|C| = p^j$ for some $j \leqslant k$. By definition, $C$ is abelian. By 15.H, $C$ must contain at least one element of order $p$ (because $p$ is a prime factor of $p^j$).
    \item Being cyclic, $\angled{a}$ is a subgroup of $G$. Furthermore, $a$ is in the center of $G$. So, for all $x \in \angled{a}$ and all $g \in G$, $gx = xg$, which means that all elements $gxg^{-1}$ are in $\angled{a}$.  Therefore $\angled{a}$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
    \item $|G/\angled{a}| = p^{k - 1}$. Applying steps 1 and 2 again, we get another subgroup of order $p^{k - 2}$ and so on down to order $p^1$.
\end{enumerate}
